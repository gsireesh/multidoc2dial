Letting Insurance Lapse   Because we all pay indirectly for crashes involving uninsured motorists ,  New York State requires every motorist to maintain auto insurance every single day a vehicle is registered.  DMV works with insurance companies to electronically monitor your insurance coverage ,  and we know when coverage is dropped for any reason.  When that happens ,  we mail you an insurance inquiry letter to allow you to clear up the problem.  We send 500,000 inquiry letters a year.  If the inquiry letter does not resolve the problem ,  we must suspend the vehicle registration and ,  if it persists, your driver license!We suspend 300,000 registrations a year for failure to maintain insurance.  If you fail to maintain an updated address with us ,  you won t learn that you have an insurance problem ,  and we will suspend your registration and license.  Make sure you turn in your vehicle s license plates at DMV before you cancel your insurance policy.  Insurance policies must be from a company licensed in New York State.
