During a program review ,  reviewers evaluate the school s compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the school must take to improve its future administrative capabilities.  After completing a program review ,  Federal Student Aid issues a Final Program Review Determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each finding identified in the program review report, the school\\'s response, and the Department s final determination.  The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review; provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate; notifies the institution of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as appropriate; and closes the program review, if appropriate.  The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the institution.  Future FPRDs will be posted regularly.

You do not need a number to conduct business with a bank, register for school, apply for educational tests, obtain private health insurance, apply for school lunch programs or apply for subsidized housing.  You cannot get a Social Security number for the sole purpose of obtaining a driver's license.  Government benefits or services :  If your child does not have permission to work ,  the child may apply for a Social Security number only if :  A federal law requires your child to provide a Social Security number to get a particular benefit or service ;  or  A state or local law requires you to provide your Social Security number to get general assistance benefits for which you already have qualified.  If your child needs a number to meet these state or local requirements ,  you must bring us a letter from the government agency.  It must be on letterhead stationery no form letters or photocopies and :  Specifically identify your child as the applicant ;  Cite the law requiring your child to have a Social Security number ;  Indicate that your child meets all the agency's requirements, except having the number ;  and  Contain an agency contact name and telephone number.  Taxes:  If you need a number for your child for tax purposes and your child is not authorized to work in the United States ,  you can apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number for your child from the Internal Revenue Service IRS.  Visit IRS in person or call the IRS toll - free number , 1 - 800-TAXFORM 1 - 800 - 829 - 3676, and request Form W-7A Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions.  If you are assigned a number for non - work purposes ,  you cannot use it to work.  If you use it to work ,  we will inform DHS.  Age  You must present your child's foreign birth certificate if you have it or can get it within 10 days.  If not ,  we will consider other documents such as your child's passport or a document issued by DHS as evidence of your child's age.  Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview.  We will ask for evidence to show that your child does not have a Social Security number.  If your child lived outside the United States for an extended period ,  a current or previous passport ,  school and/or employment records ,  and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States could be used to show that your child does not have a Social Security number.

Acceptable documents include :  I-551 Permanent Resident Card ;  I-94 Arrival / Departure Record with unexpired foreign passport ;  or  I-766 Employment Authorization Document ,  EAD, work permit from DHS.  If your child does not have a current DHS document ,  we can accept only certain documents as proof of your child's identity.  An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph.  We generally can accept a non - photo identity document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child's name and age, date of birth or parents' names.  We prefer to see the child's U.S. passport.  If that document is not available ,  we may accept the child's :  Adoption decree ;  Doctor, clinic or hospital record ;  Religious record ;  School daycare center record ;  or  School identification card.  You :  We also must see proof of your identity.

Before you take out a loan ,  it s important to understand that a loan is a legal obligation that makes you responsible for repaying the amount you borrow with interest.  Even though you don t have to begin repaying your federal student loans right away ,  you shouldn t wait to understand your responsibilities as a borrower.  Get the scoop: Watch this video about responsible borrowing or browse the tips below it.  Be a responsible borrower.  Keep track of how much you re borrowing.  Think about how the amount of your loans will affect your future finances, and how much you can afford to repay.  Your student loan payments should be only a small percentage of your salary after you graduate ,  so it s important not to borrow more than you need for your school - related expenses.  Research starting salaries in your field.  Ask your school for starting salaries of recent graduates in your field of study to get an idea of how much you are likely to earn after you graduate.  You can also use the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook or career search tool to research careers and salaries.  Understand the terms of your loan and keep copies of your loan documents.  When you sign your promissory note ,  you are agreeing to repay the loan according to the terms of the note even if you don t complete your education, can t get a job after you complete the program, or you didn t like the education you received.  Make payments on time.  You are required to make payments on time even if you don t receive a bill, repayment notice, or a reminder.  You must pay the full amount required by your repayment plan, as partial payments do not fulfill your obligation to repay your student loan on time.  Keep in touch with your loan servicer.  Notify your loan servicer when you graduate ;  withdraw from school ;  drop below half - time status ;  transfer to another school; or change your name, address, or Social Security number.  You also should contact your servicer if you re having trouble making your scheduled loan payments.  Your servicer has several options available to help you keep your loan in good standing.\", \"So no one else can use my account?[SEP]agent: Social Security is dedicated to protecting the information and resources entrusted to us , including your personal information and investment .For your protection ||agent: Your personal mySocial Security account is for your use only  Social Security is dedicated to protecting the information and resources entrusted to us , including your personal information and investment||user: That's helpful to hear.

Your school determines the loan type, if any, and the actual loan amount you are eligible to receive each academic year.  However ,  there are limits on the amount in subsidized and unsubsidized loans that you may be eligible to receive each academic year annual loan limits and the total amounts that you may borrow for undergraduate and graduate study aggregate loan limits.  The actual loan amount you are eligible to receive each academic year may be less than the annual loan limit.  These limits vary depending on  what year you are in school  and  whether you are a dependent or independent student.  If you are a dependent student whose parents are ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan ,  you may be able to receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.  The following chart shows the annual and aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans.  Notes:  The aggregate loan limits include any Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans you may have previously received under the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program.  As a result of legislation that took effect July 1 , 2010 ,  no further loans are being made under the FFEL Program.  Effective for periods of enrollment beginning on or after July 1 , 2012 ,  graduate and professional students are no longer eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans.  The $65,500 subsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate or professional students includes subsidized loans that a graduate or professional student may have received for periods of enrollment that began before July 1 , 2012, or for prior undergraduate study.  If the total loan amount you receive over the course of your education reaches the aggregate loan limit ,  you are not eligible to receive additional loans.  However ,  if you repay some of your loans to bring your outstanding loan debt below the aggregate loan limit ,  you could then borrow again, up to the amount of your remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limit.  Graduate and professional students enrolled in certain health profession programs may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts each academic year beyond those shown above.  For these students ,  there is also a higher aggregate limit on Direct Unsubsidized Loans.  If you are enrolled in a health profession program ,  talk to the financial aid office at your school for information about annual and aggregate limits.

During a program review ,  reviewers evaluate the school s compliance with FSA requirements, assess liabilities for errors in performance, and identify actions the school must take to improve its future administrative capabilities.  After completing a program review ,  Federal Student Aid issues a Final Program Review Determination FPRD, which is a report that includes each finding identified in the program review report, the school\\'s response, and the Department s final determination.  The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review; provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate; notifies the institution of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as appropriate; and closes the program review, if appropriate.  The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the institution.  Future FPRDs will be posted regularly.

If your child is a J-1 or J-2 exchange visitor ,  you must see your child's DS-2019 Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status.  Work Eligibility  In general ,  only noncitizens who have permission to work from DHS can apply for a Social Security number.  For most foreign workers ,  we only need to see an I-94 Arrival / Departure Record or admission stamp in the unexpired foreign passport showing a class of admission permitting work.  Some foreign workers must show their I-766 Employment Authorization Document, EAD, work permit from DHS.  Student :  If you are an F-1 student and eligible to work on campus ,  you must provide a letter from your designated school official that :  Identifies you ;  Confirms your current school status ;  and  Identifies your employer and the type of work you are, or will be, doing.  We also need to see evidence of that employment, such as a recent pay slip or a letter from your employer.  Your supervisor must sign and date the letter.  The letter must describe :  Your job;  Your employment start date ;  The number of hours you are, or will be, working ;  and  Your supervisor's name and telephone number.  If you are an F-1 student authorized to work in curricular practical training CPT ,  you must provide us your Form I-20 with the employment page completed and signed by your designated school official.  If you are an F-1 student and have a work permit I-766 from DHS ,  you must present it.  If you are a J-1 student, student intern or international visitor ,  you must provide a letter from your sponsor.  The letter should be on sponsor letterhead with an original signature that authorizes your employment.  If your child does not have permission to work :  Lawfully admitted noncitizens can get many benefits and services without a Social Security number.  You do not need a number to conduct business with a bank, register for school, apply for educational tests, obtain private health insurance, apply for school lunch programs or apply for subsidized housing.  You cannot get a Social Security number for the sole purpose of obtaining a driver's license.  Government benefits or services :  If your child does not have permission to work ,  the child may apply for a Social Security number only if :  A federal law requires your child to provide a Social Security number to get a particular benefit or service ;  or  A state or local law requires you to provide your Social Security number to get general assistance benefits for which you already have qualified.  If your child needs a number to meet these state or local requirements ,  you must bring us a letter from the government agency.  It must be on letterhead stationery no form letters or photocopies and :  Specifically identify your child as the applicant ;  Cite the law requiring your child to have a Social Security number ;  Indicate that your child meets all the agency's requirements, except having the number ;  and  Contain an agency contact name and telephone number.  Taxes:  If you need a number for your child for tax purposes and your child is not authorized to work in the United States ,  you can apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number for your child from the Internal Revenue Service IRS.  Visit IRS in person or call the IRS toll - free number , 1 - 800-TAXFORM 1 - 800 - 829 - 3676, and request Form W-7A Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions.  If you are assigned a number for non - work purposes ,  you cannot use it to work.  If you use it to work ,  we will inform DHS.  Age  You must present your child's foreign birth certificate if you have it or can get it within 10 days.  If not ,  we will consider other documents such as your child's passport or a document issued by DHS as evidence of your child's age.  Anyone age 12 or older requesting an original Social Security number must appear in person for an interview.  We will ask for evidence to show that your child does not have a Social Security number.  If your child lived outside the United States for an extended period ,  a current or previous passport ,  school and/or employment records ,  and any other record that would show long - term residence outside the United States could be used to show that your child does not have a Social Security number.  Identity  Your child :  Social Security will ask to see your child's current DHS document.  Acceptable documents include :  I-551 Permanent Resident Card ;  I-94 Arrival / Departure Record with unexpired foreign passport ;  or  I-766 Employment Authorization Document ,  EAD, work permit from DHS.  If your child does not have a current DHS document ,  we can accept only certain documents as proof of your child's identity.  An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph.  We generally can accept a non - photo identity document if it has enough information to identify the child such as the child's name and age, date of birth or parents' names.  We prefer to see the child's U.S. passport.  If that document is not available ,  we may accept the child's :  Adoption decree ;  Doctor, clinic or hospital record ;  Religious record ;  School daycare center record ;  or  School identification card.  You :  We also must see proof of your identity.  An acceptable document must show your child's name, identifying information i.e., age, date of birth, or parents' names and preferably a recent photograph.  For example ,  as proof of identity Social Security must see your :  U.S. driver's license ;  State - issued non - driver identification card ;  or  U.S. passport.  If you do not have one of these specific documents or you cannot get a replacement for one of them within 10 days ,  we will ask to see other documents.  Any documents submitted, including the following, must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph :  Employee identification card ;  School identification card ;  Health insurance card not a Medicare card ;  or  U.S. military identification card.  If you are not a U.S. citizen ,  Social Security will ask to see a current DHS document.

Before you take out a loan ,  it s important to understand that a loan is a legal obligation that makes you responsible for repaying the amount you borrow with interest.  Even though you don t have to begin repaying your federal student loans right away ,  you shouldn t wait to understand your responsibilities as a borrower.  Get the scoop: Watch this video about responsible borrowing or browse the tips below it.  Be a responsible borrower.  Keep track of how much you re borrowing.  Think about how the amount of your loans will affect your future finances, and how much you can afford to repay.  Your student loan payments should be only a small percentage of your salary after you graduate ,  so it s important not to borrow more than you need for your school - related expenses.  Research starting salaries in your field.  Ask your school for starting salaries of recent graduates in your field of study to get an idea of how much you are likely to earn after you graduate.  You can also use the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook or career search tool to research careers and salaries.  Understand the terms of your loan and keep copies of your loan documents.  When you sign your promissory note ,  you are agreeing to repay the loan according to the terms of the note even if you don t complete your education, can t get a job after you complete the program, or you didn t like the education you received.  Make payments on time.  You are required to make payments on time even if you don t receive a bill, repayment notice, or a reminder.  You must pay the full amount required by your repayment plan, as partial payments do not fulfill your obligation to repay your student loan on time.  Keep in touch with your loan servicer.  Notify your loan servicer when you graduate ;  withdraw from school ;  drop below half - time status ;  transfer to another school; or change your name, address, or Social Security number.  You also should contact your servicer if you re having trouble making your scheduled loan payments.  Your servicer has several options available to help you keep your loan in good standing.\", \"So no one else can use my account?[SEP]agent: Social Security is dedicated to protecting the information and resources entrusted to us , including your personal information and investment .For your protection ||agent: Your personal mySocial Security account is for your use only  Social Security is dedicated to protecting the information and resources entrusted to us , including your personal information and investment||user: That's helpful to hear.

Your school determines the loan type, if any, and the actual loan amount you are eligible to receive each academic year.  However ,  there are limits on the amount in subsidized and unsubsidized loans that you may be eligible to receive each academic year annual loan limits and the total amounts that you may borrow for undergraduate and graduate study aggregate loan limits.  The actual loan amount you are eligible to receive each academic year may be less than the annual loan limit.  These limits vary depending on  what year you are in school  and  whether you are a dependent or independent student.  If you are a dependent student whose parents are ineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan ,  you may be able to receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.  The following chart shows the annual and aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans.  Notes:  The aggregate loan limits include any Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans you may have previously received under the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program.  As a result of legislation that took effect July 1 , 2010 ,  no further loans are being made under the FFEL Program.  Effective for periods of enrollment beginning on or after July 1 , 2012 ,  graduate and professional students are no longer eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans.  The $65,500 subsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate or professional students includes subsidized loans that a graduate or professional student may have received for periods of enrollment that began before July 1 , 2012, or for prior undergraduate study.  If the total loan amount you receive over the course of your education reaches the aggregate loan limit ,  you are not eligible to receive additional loans.  However ,  if you repay some of your loans to bring your outstanding loan debt below the aggregate loan limit ,  you could then borrow again, up to the amount of your remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limit.  Graduate and professional students enrolled in certain health profession programs may receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts each academic year beyond those shown above.  For these students ,  there is also a higher aggregate limit on Direct Unsubsidized Loans.  If you are enrolled in a health profession program ,  talk to the financial aid office at your school for information about annual and aggregate limits.

If your child is an F-1 or M-1 student ,  we must see your child's I-20 Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.  If your child is a J-1 or J-2 exchange visitor ,  you must see your child's DS-2019 Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status.  Work Eligibility  In general ,  only noncitizens who have permission to work from DHS can apply for a Social Security number.  If you are a foreign worker ,  we only need to see an I-94 Arrival / Departure Record or admission stamp in the unexpired foreign passport, showing a class of admission permitting work.  Some foreign workers must show their I-766 Employment Authorization Document, EAD, work permit from DHS.  If you submit evidence of lawful work - authorized status for your child along with evidence of name change ,  we can issue your child a corrected card with his or her new name.  However ,  if we assigned your child a Social Security number for non - work purposes ,  special rules apply.  If your child is not authorized to work by DHS, we will change your child's name on our records ,  but we cannot issue a corrected card.  Your child cannot use a Social Security number assigned for non - work purposes to work.  If your child does use it to work ,  we will inform DHS.  Student :  If you are an F-1 student and eligible to work on campus ,  you must provide a letter from your designated school official that :  Identifies you ;  Confirms your current school status ;  and  Identifies your employer and the type of work you are, or will be, doing.  We also need to see evidence of that employment, such as a recent pay slip or a letter from your employer.  Your supervisor must sign and date the letter.  The letter must describe :  Your job;  Your employment start date ;  The number of hours you are, or will be, working ;  and  Your supervisor's name and telephone number.  If you are an F-1 student authorized to work in curricular practical training CPT ,  you must provide us your Form I-20 with the employment page completed and signed by your designated school official.  If you are an F-1 student and have a work permit I-766 from DHS ,  you must present it.  If you are a J-1 student, student intern or international visitor ,  you must provide a letter from your sponsor.  The letter should be on sponsor letterhead with an original signature that authorizes your employment.  Name Change  If you need to change the name on your child's Social Security record ,  you must show us proof of your child's legal name change.  Documents Social Security may accept to prove your child's legal name change include :  Final adoption decree with the new name ;  Court order approving the name change.  If the document you provide as evidence of your child's legal name change does not give us enough information to identify your child in our records or if you changed your child's name more than four years ago ,  you must show us an identity document in your child's prior name as shown in our records.  We will accept an identity document in your child's old name that has expired.  If you do not have an identity document in your child's prior name ,  we may accept an unexpired identity document in your child's new name, as long as we can properly establish your child's identity in our records.  Identity  Your child :  Social Security will ask to see your child's current U.S. immigration document from DHS.  Acceptable immigration documents include your child's :  I-551 Permanent Resident Card ;  I-94 Arrival / Departure Record with unexpired foreign passport or admission stamp in the unexpired foreign passport ;  or  I-766 Employment Authorization Document ,  EAD, work permit from DHS.

If you do not have one of these specific documents or you cannot get a replacement for one of them within 10 days ,  we will ask to see other documents.  Any documents submitted, including the following, must be current not expired and show your name, identifying information date of birth or age and preferably a recent photograph :  Employee identification card ;  School identification card ;  Health insurance card not a Medicare card ;  U.S. military identification card ;  or  Doctor ,  clinic or hospital record.
